# UDPIH Payload collection
Some random payloads which can be launched using [UDPIH](https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/udpih).  
[You can find the original recovery_menu here!](https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/recovery_menu).  
All files here will be called `recovery_menu` as well, since that's what udpih launches.  

## rpx_replacement
Replaces the next loaded channel with a `launch.rpx` from the root of the SD on boot.  
Also gives all loaded rpx full permissions and codegen access.
